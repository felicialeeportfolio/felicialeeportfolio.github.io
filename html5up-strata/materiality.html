				<p> A lack of understanding between providers and users would often lead to frustration and eventually discontinuation of the service, even though both parties could potentially benefit each other with a simple workaround. 	
				<br><br>In this project, our group sought to have a deeper understanding of the various interactions between service providers and usersâ€™ needs to design a new servicescape of digital services.

					Through multiple surveys, interviews and co-design workshop, we identified a lack of proper transitioning for older working adults into retirement life. The moment one stops working, they find themselves having too much time, leading to a rise in health issues.
					<br> <br>Targetting older working adults aged 55 and above, we designed an eco-system to create an easy transition from working to retirement life.
