					<b>How might we instil elements of fun to rehab and reduce the burden of caregivers?</b>

			<div class="paragraph1">
				<p> Through our weekly observations at AWWA, our group noticed one afternoon that an elderly patient was carrying out a simple pinching and arm exercise on a wooden device. Amidst the accompanying flashing lights and beeping sounds, the elderly patient – while holding onto a clothespin in his hand – was completely disengaged from the rehab device.

					We asked ourselves, “How might we design a sustainable system which maintains users’ engagement in the long run?”
				<br><br><br><em>Perry</em> was then birthed to work in tandem with the Xbox Kinect. Utilizing a USB Bluetooth connection to any computer devices, Perry, the pinch controller, can be used to play various mouse-based games.

					After each session, results are collected and visualised on the therapists’ end to improve targeted therapy and patients’ outcomes.

					As the patients are required to switch from one hand to the other when performing their rehab, multiple form explorations were done on the controller to ensure an intuitive and easy grip on both the left and right hands. 					
					<br><br><br>With the patients’ different cognitive and physiological levels in mind, Perry was designed to fit various curated games categorised into memory, puzzles and reaction time.				</p>

				<p>	<br><br><b>Design process and challenge:</b> Keeping the action of pinching and playing in mind, we went through a series of iterative process while trying to concoct a new game, only to realise that our focus was on creating something physical and repetitive, just like the original wooden device. 
					<br><br>Instead of designing physical games, we eventually delved into the idea of curating pre-existing digital games. Through our explorations with various pinching actions and its accompany games, we finally scoped down to a wireless controller activated with Kinect tracking. 
					<br><BR><b>Skills:</b> Kinect SDK, Figma, Arduino

					<br> <b>Timeline:</b> 13 weeks, Designed with Sherwin Ng and Yeo Jun Peng
