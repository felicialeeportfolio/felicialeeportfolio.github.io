                    <b>2018 ST Aerospace Aircraft Seat (STAAS) Design Competition - First Place</b>

                   <br><br> This competition was conducted in collaboration between NUS and <a href="https://www.stengg.com/en/singapore-technologies-engineering/" style="text-decoration:underline">ST Engineering</a>
                     to envision design concepts that revolutionize the aircraft economy class for the next generation of aircraft seats.
                    <br><br>Through a series of surveys and prototyping, our group came up with the 'Airmock' - a hammock seat design with sliding mechanisms at the top and bottom of the chair, completed with mesh backing that is both flexible and light, yet strong.
					<br><br><b>Timeline:</b> 1 month, Designed with Janna Tan and Deborah Loh
